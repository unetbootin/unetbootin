  \class QXmlNamePool
  \brief The QXmlNamePool class is a table of shared strings referenced by instances of QXmlName.
  \reentrant
  \since 4.4
  \ingroup xml-tools

  QXmlNamePool is used to optimize operations on instances of
  QXmlName. An instance of QXmlName represents an XML name in
  a way that allows the XML name to be compared and passed around
  efficiently. The efficiency is achieved by storing the strings
  comprising the XML names in an instance of QXmlNamePool, where
  they are mapped to binary identifiers, which are then packed
  into a key which is stored in the QXmlName.

  This means that each instance of QXmlName is tied to the name
  pool it was created with, and that name pool should be kept in
  scope and used to create all instances of QXmlName that might
  be compared. Note also that the name pool is required if you
  must reconstitute the QXmlName as text, or if you must access
  any of its component strings, so although instances of
  QXmlName can be compared without reference to a name pool, the
  name pool must be kept in scope if the name's strings must be
  accessed later.
