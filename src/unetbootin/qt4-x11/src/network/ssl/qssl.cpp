QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE

/*! \namespace QSsl

    \brief The QSsl namespace declares enums common to all SSL classes in QtNetwork.
    \since 4.3

    \ingroup io
    \inmodule QtNetwork
*/

/*!
    \enum QSsl::KeyType

    Describes the two types of keys QSslKey supports.
    
    \value PrivateKey A private key.
    \value PublicKey A public key.
*/

/*!
    \enum QSsl::KeyAlgorithm

    Describes the different key algorithms supported by QSslKey.

    \value Rsa The RSA algorithm.
    \value Dsa The DSA algorithm.
*/

/*!
    \enum QSsl::EncodingFormat

    Describes supported encoding formats for certificates and keys.

    \value Pem The PEM format.
    \value Der The DER format.
*/

/*!
    \enum QSsl::AlternateNameEntryType

    Describes the key types for alternate name entries in QSslCertificate.

    \value EmailEntry An email entry; the entry contains an email address that
    the certificate is valid for.

    \value DnsEntry A DNS host name entry; the entry contains a host name
    entry that the certificate is valid for. The entry may contain wildcards.

    \sa QSslCertificate::alternateSubjectNames()

*/

/*!
    \enum QSsl::SslProtocol

    Describes the protocol of the cipher.

    \value SslV3 SSLv3 - the default protocol.
    \value SslV2 SSLv2
    \value TlsV1 TLSv1
    \value UnknownProtocol The cipher's protocol cannot be determined.
    \value AnyProtocol The socket understands SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1. This
    value is used by QSslSocket only.

    Note: most servers using SSL understand both versions (2 and 3),
    but it is recommended to use the latest version only for security
    reasons. However, SSL and TLS are not compatible with each other:
    if you get unexpected handshake failures, verify that you chose
    the correct setting for your protocol.
