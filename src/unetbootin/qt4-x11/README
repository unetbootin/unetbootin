This is Qt version 4.5.0.

Qt is a comprehensive cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt 4
introduces new features and many improvements over the 3.x series. See
http://doc.trolltech.com/latest/qt4-intro.html for details.

The Qt 4.x series is not binary compatible or source compatible with
the 3.x series. For more information on porting from Qt 3 to Qt 4, see
http://doc.trolltech.com/latest/porting4.html.


INSTALLING Qt

On Windows and Mac OS X, if you want to install the precompiled binary
packages, simply launch the package and follow the instructions in the
installation wizard.

On Mac OS X, the binary package requires Mac OS X 10.4.x (Tiger) or
later and GCC 4.0.1 to develop applications. Its applications will run
on Mac OS X 10.3.9 and above.

If you have a source package (a .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, or .zip file),
follow the instructions in the INSTALL file.


DEMOS AND EXAMPLES

Once Qt is installed, we suggest that you take a look at the demos and
examples to see Qt in action. Run the Qt Examples and Demos either by
typing 'qtdemo' on the command line or through the desktop's Start
menu. On Mac OS X, you can find it in /Developers/Applications/Qt.


REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

The Qt reference documentation is available locally in Qt's doc/html
directory. You can use Qt Assistant to view it; to launch Assistant,
type 'assistant' on the command line or use the Start menu. On Mac OS
X, you can find it in /Developer/Applications/Qt.  The latest
documentation is available at http://doc.trolltech.com/.

HOW TO REPORT A BUG

If you think you have found a bug in Qt, we would like to hear about
it so that we can fix it. Before reporting a bug, please check
http://qtsoftware.com/developer/faqs/ and
http://qtsoftware.com/products/appdev/platform/platforms/ to see if the to see if
the issue is already known.

Always include the following information in your bug report: the name
and version number of your compiler; the name and version number of
your operating system; the version of Qt you are using, and what
configure options it was compiled with.

If the problem you are reporting is only visible at run-time, try to
create a small test program that shows the problem when run. Often,
such a program can be created with some minor changes to one of the
many example programs in Qt's examples directory. Please submit the
bug report using the Task Tracker on the Trolltech website:
