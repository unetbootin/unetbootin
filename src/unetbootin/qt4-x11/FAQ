This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions regarding Qt Release 4.5.0.

Q: I'm using a Unix system and I downloaded the Zip package. However when I try
to run the configure script I get the following error message:
"bash: ./configure: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory"
A: The problem here is converting files from Windows style line endings (CRLF)
to Unix style line endings (LF). To avoid this problem, uncompress the file
again but this time specify the option "-a" to unzip, so it adds the right line
endings.

Q: I'm running Windows XP and I downloaded the qt-win-eval-4.5.0-vs2008.exe
version of Qt. However when I try to run the examples I get an error saying:
"The application failed to start because the application configuration is
incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.". I reinstalled
the package and the error persists, what am I doing wrong?
A: The problem is an incorrect version of the CRT. Visual studio requires CRT90
while Windows XP comes with CRT80. To solve this problem please install the
2008 CRT redistributable package from Microsoft.
