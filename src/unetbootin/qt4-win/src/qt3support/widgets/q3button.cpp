    \brief The Q3Button class is a compatibility base class of button
    widgets

    \compat

    \bold{In new code, use QAbstractButton.}

    To subclass Q3Button, you must reimplement at least drawButton()
    (to draw the button's outline) and drawButtonLabel() (to draw its
    text or pixmap). It is generally advisable to reimplement
    sizeHint() as well, and sometimes hitButton() (to determine
    whether a button press is within the button).
*/

/*!
    Constructs a standard button called \a name with parent \a parent,
    using the widget flags \a f.
*/

Q3Button::Q3Button( QWidget *parent, const char *name, Qt::WindowFlags f )

/*!
    \fn void Q3Button::paintEvent( QPaintEvent *event)

    Handles paint events, received in \a event, for buttons. Small and
    typically complex buttons are painted double-buffered to reduce
    flicker. The actually drawing is done in the virtual functions
    drawButton() and drawButtonLabel().

/*!
    \fn void Q3Button::drawButton( QPainter *painter)

    Draws the button on the given \a painter. The default
    implementation does nothing.

    This virtual function is reimplemented by subclasses to draw real
    buttons. At some point, these reimplementations should call
    drawButtonLabel().
