    <pre>         THE Q PUBLIC LICENSE
         version 1.0

         Copyright (C) 1999-2008 Trolltech ASA, Norway.
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute this license document.

         The intent of this license is to establish freedom to share and change the
         software regulated by this license under the open source model.

         This license applies to any software containing a notice placed by the
         copyright holder saying that it may be distributed under the terms of
         the Q Public License version 1.0. Such software is herein referred to as
         the Software. This license covers modification and distribution of the
         Software, use of third-party application programs based on the Software,
         and development of free software which uses the Software.

                                          Granted Rights

         1. You are granted the non-exclusive rights set forth in this license
            provided you agree to and comply with any and all conditions in this
            license. Whole or partial distribution of the Software, or software
            items that link with the Software, in any form signifies acceptance of
            this license.

         2. You may copy and distribute the Software in unmodified form provided
            that the entire package, including - but not restricted to - copyright,
            trademark notices and disclaimers, as released by the initial developer
            of the Software, is distributed.

         3. You may make modifications to the Software and distribute your
            modifications, in a form that is separate from the Software, such as
            patches. The following restrictions apply to modifications:

              a. Modifications must not alter or remove any copyright notices in
                 the Software.

              b. When modifications to the Software are released under this
                 license, a non-exclusive royalty-free right is granted to the
                 initial developer of the Software to distribute your modification
                 in future versions of the Software provided such versions remain
                 available under these terms in addition to any other license(s) of
                 the initial developer.

         4. You may distribute machine-executable forms of the Software or
            machine-executable forms of modified versions of the Software, provided
            that you meet these restrictions:

              a. You must include this license document in the distribution.

              b. You must ensure that all recipients of the machine-executable forms
                 are also able to receive the complete machine-readable source code
                 to the distributed Software, including all modifications, without
                 any charge beyond the costs of data transfer, and place prominent
                 notices in the distribution explaining this.

              c. You must ensure that all modifications included in the
                 machine-executable forms are available under the terms of this
                 license.

         5. You may use the original or modified versions of the Software to
            compile, link and run application programs legally developed by you
            or by others.

         6. You may develop application programs, reusable components and other
            software items that link with the original or modified versions of the
            Software. These items, when distributed, are subject to the following
            requirements:

              a. You must ensure that all recipients of machine-executable forms of
                 these items are also able to receive and use the complete
                 machine-readable source code to the items without any charge
                 beyond the costs of data transfer.

              b. You must explicitly license all recipients of your items to use
                 and re-distribute original and modified versions of the items in
                 both machine-executable and source code forms. The recipients must
                 be able to do so without any charges whatsoever, and they must be
                 able to re-distribute to anyone they choose.

              c. If the items are not available to the general public, and the
                 initial developer of the Software requests a copy of the items,
                 then you must supply one.

                                     Limitations of Liability

         In no event shall the initial developers or copyright holders be liable
         for any damages whatsoever, including - but not restricted to - lost
         revenue or profits or other direct, indirect, special, incidental or
         consequential damages, even if they have been advised of the possibility
         of such damages, except to the extent invariable law, if any, provides
         otherwise.

                                           No Warranty

         The Software and this license document are provided AS IS with NO WARRANTY
         OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF DESIGN, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
         FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

                                          Choice of Law

         This license is governed by the Laws of Norway. Disputes shall be settled
         by Oslo City Court.</pre>
