   \class Dialog

   \brief This class is a simple example of how to use QSharedMemory.

   It is a simple dialog that presents a few buttons. To compile the
   example, run make in qt/examples/ipc. Then run the executable twice
   to create two processes running the dialog. In one of the processes,
   press the button to load an image into a shared memory segment, and
   then select an image file to load. Once the first process has loaded
   and displayed the image, in the second process, press the button to
   read the same image from shared memory. The second process displays
   the same image loaded from its new loaction in shared memory.
 */</span>

<span class="comment"> /*!
   The class contains a data member \l {QSharedMemory} {sharedMemory},
   which is initialized with the key &quot;QSharedMemoryExample&quot; to force
   all instances of Dialog to access the same shared memory segment.
   The constructor also connects the clicked() signal from each of the
   three dialog buttons to the slot function appropriate for handling
   each button.

<span class="comment"> /*!
   This slot function is called when the \tt {Load Image From File...}
   button is pressed on the firs Dialog process. First, it tests
   whether the process is already connected to a shared memory segment
   and, if so, detaches from that segment. This ensures that we always
   start the example from the beginning if we run it multiple times
   with the same two Dialog processes. After detaching from an existing
   shared memory segment, the user is prompted to select an image file.
   The selected file is loaded into a QImage. The QImage is displayed
   in the Dialog and streamed into a QBuffer with a QDataStream.

   Next, it gets a new shared memory segment from the system big enough
   to hold the image data in the QBuffer, and it locks the segment to
   prevent the second Dialog process from accessing it. Then it copies
   the image from the QBuffer into the shared memory segment. Finally,
   it unlocks the shared memory segment so the second Dialog process
   can access it.

   After this function runs, the user is expected to press the \tt
   {Load Image from Shared Memory} button on the second Dialog process.
