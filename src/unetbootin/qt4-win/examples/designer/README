Qt Designer is a capable graphical user interface designer that lets you
create and configure forms without writing code. GUIs created with
Qt Designer can be compiled into an application or created at run-time.


Some of the examples in this directory can be run from the example launcher;
others can only be used from within Qt Designer.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the "Tutorial and Examples"
link in the main Qt documentation.

Finding the Qt Examples and Demos launcher
==========================================

On Windows:

The launcher can be accessed via the Windows Start menu. Select the menu
entry entitled "Qt Examples and Demos" entry in the submenu containing
the Qt tools.

On Mac OS X:

For the binary distribution, the qtdemo executable is installed in the
/Developer/Applications/Qt directory. For the source distribution, it is
installed alongside the other Qt tools on the path specified when Qt is
configured.

On Unix/Linux:

The qtdemo executable is installed alongside the other Qt tools on the path
specified when Qt is configured.

On all platforms:
