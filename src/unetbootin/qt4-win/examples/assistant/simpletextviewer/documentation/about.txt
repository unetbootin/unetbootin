The Simple Text Viewer enables the user to select and view existing
files.

HTML files is displayed using rich text, while other files are
presented as plain text. The application provides a file dialog
allowing the user to search for files using wildcard matching. The
search is performed within in the specified directory, and the user is
given an option to browse the existing file system to find the
relevant directory.
