Qt usese the Phonon cross-platform multimedia framework to play common
multimedia formats.

Applications can be written to take advantage of the native multimedia
technologies on each platform via a consistent cross-platform Qt API.


Some of the examples in this directory can be run from the example launcher;
others can only be used from within Qt Designer.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the "Tutorial and Examples"
link in the main Qt documentation.
